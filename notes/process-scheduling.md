# Process Scheduling

## Task Traits
I/O bound or processor bound.


## Completely Fair Scheduler, CFS
>CFS is based on a simple concept: Model process scheduling as if the system had an ideal, perfectly multitasking processor. In such a system, each process would receive 1/n of the processor’s time, where n is the number of runnable processes, and we’d schedule them for infinitely small durations, so that in any measurable period we’d have run all n processes for the same amount of time.
